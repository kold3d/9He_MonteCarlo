** Comment on key RTYP:
** RTYP is used to define what reaction should be Simulated at
** this time.
** 1   1H(7Be,1H)7Be - elastic scattering.
** 2   9Be(pi-,pi+)9He(g.s.,stable at +1.13 MeV) 
** 3   9Be(pi-,pi+)(8He+n)

** Comment on key ANDI:
** If ANDI is set to 1, external angular distribution should be
** taken from the file ang.dat (first coloumn is angle in degrees
** second is the cross section in any units.) 
** If ANDI is set to 0, Angular distribution for the reaction
** will be constant. (Cross section is independent from angle).
** Comments on ENDI key:
** If ENDI 1 is set to 0. THEN
**   Excitation function is a single peak with centroid and
**   width set by ENDI 2 and 3. Width is FWHM.  

** Comments on user defined parameters:
** TSTA - defines the target state. L - liquid; S - solid; G - gas
** Gpre - if TSTA=G Gpre defines gass pressure in mBar
** LDEN - if TSTA=L LDEN defines density of liquid in g/cm^3
** APDE - Distance between the detector(colimator actually)
**        and the center of rotation. 
** AANG - Lab. angle of the detector relative to the beam
** BANG - Angular distribution of the beam, first is the avarage angle  
**        (usually 0.), the second is angular spread (sigma). All in degrees 
** BENE - Energy and energy spread of the beam; E0+/-dE (dE is gauss sigma)
**        in MeV
** BRAD - Beam radius(cm) on target or entrance window (depends on target state)
**        If solid target is used - on target, gass or liquid - on window
** RDET - Radius of the colimator on the face of the detector.
**        Maximum is 1.5 cm, because detectors themself are 1.5 cm
**        If larger radius is needed you should make changes in the code.
